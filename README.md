# PHP Object Injection Slinger

This is an extension for Burp Suite Professional, designed to help you scan for [PHP Object Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection) vulnerabilities on popular PHP Frameworks and some of their dependencies.
It will send a serialized PHP Object to the web application designed to force the web server to perform a DNS lookup to a Burp Collaborator Callback Host.


### Contribute
Feedback, testing and issue reporting is welcome.


### Credits
The payloads for this extension are all from the excellent [Ambionics](https://ambionics.io/blog) project [`PHPGGC`](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc).
`PHPGGC` is a library of PHP unserialize() payloads along with a tool to generate them, from command line or programmatically.
You will need it for further exploiting any vulnerabilities found by this extension.

You should combine your testing with the [`PHP Object Injection Check`](https://github.com/securifybv/PHPUnserializeCheck) extension from [Securify](https://securify.nl) so you can identify other possible PHP Object Injection issues that this extension does not pick up.
